                          <p>I was the first pediatrician to present medical research regarding the use of computers to record documentation and to calculate infant intravenous support. With my partners in Pediatrix Medical Group, we were able to further treatment for infants throughout the United States, providing a new, improved level of in-hospital care for high risk newborns.</p>

                          <p>This newly emerging epidemic of Attention Deficit and Autism Spectrum disorders has inspired me to direct my training and practice to focus on problems with childhood development. Because there has been such an explosion of families who are affected by these challenges, I am in a unique position to help evaluate all of the available research and treatments, and to provide a combination of all of the proposed therapies so that my patients have the best chance to achieve their highest potential.</p>
