                        <p>Our Intensive PediaSuit Protocol™ Program for Cerebral Palsy, ?Down Syndrome, Developmental Delays, Autism and Traumatic Brain Injuries is safe, without surgery or drugs, utilizing natural movements, combined with unique high tech equipment such as the Spider Cage, Ability Exercise Unit and Suit Therapy.</p>

                        <p>At the core, we are compressing 7-1/2 months of traditional treatment into 4 “intensive” weeks while using some very special tools in very unique ways.</p>

                        <p>Combined with our daily intensive program, the PediaSuit Protocol™ accelerates the development of new motor skills that eventually strengthen muscles and teach the brain and body how to sit, stand, and walk.</p>

                        <p>The program at Therapies 4 Kids, Inc. is designed specifically to enhance growth and development in each child. We start with a free screening and then a comprehensive evaluation.</p>

                        <p>The Intensive Therapy combined with the PediaSuit Protocol™ has proven over and over to achieve improvements quicker than with traditional therapy.</p>
